# Criegee-Water-Rate is a set of codes for analyzing the transient
# absorption signal of Criegee intermediate while reacting with water

The code is written in Python2, using packages numpy, scipy 
and matplotlib. Minor modifications must be made to make the 
codes Python3 compatible. The codes are tested with Python 2.7
under OSX.

A sample for analyzing the data is written in file 'sample_run.sh',
a shell script run in Unix-like environment (Linux/BSD). Running the
script under windows may require Cygwin or modifying the code 
accordingly for windows command-line.

***Important Note***
The file 'datastack.py' contains the file number of background and
signal data. One must first modify the file so that future processes
may correctly handle the data.

*Sample steps for data analysis
1. modify 'datastack.py'
2. run sample_run.sh
